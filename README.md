# Athena NLP Curriculum Repository

## Introduction

This repository includes code, literature, and supplementary materials for each section of our journey through Natural Language Processing. Find below a table of contents that lists the contents, author, date, and assets for each section. Each section has its own `requirements.txt` and should ideally be created using a separate `conda` environment, for example:

```python
conda create -n nlpcurr_perplexity python=3.10.12
```
